# Changelog

## 0.4.2

- Fix - Redirects: a rule pointing at a custom post type no longer produces two
  chained 301s (`/old` -> `/?p=73` -> pretty URL). The engine now runs on
  `init` priority 99, after custom post types are registered, and
  `Repository::resolve_target()` only trusts `get_permalink()` when the post
  type exists and the result is not a plain `?p=ID` link; otherwise the stored
  (relative) target is used. Rules still follow slug changes of their target.
- Fix - Redirects: a target with an anchor or query (`/#kontakt`, `/shop/?x=1`)
  is no longer bound to a post id, so the `#fragment` / query is kept. Rules
  saved earlier with an anchor get the anchor re-appended to the live
  permalink.
- Tests: `tests/redirects-cpt-target.php` (manual, `wp eval-file`).

## 0.4.1

- Security - Access Control: with *Restrict REST API to logged-in users* on,
  `/complianz/v1/` is now public by default, so the Complianz cookie banner
  loads and consent is stored without a workaround. The built-in list is the
  initial value of the `uxstudio_rest_public_routes` filter; the match is still
  a strict prefix on the resolved route. Core routes (`/wp/v2/users`…) stay
  closed for anonymous visitors.
